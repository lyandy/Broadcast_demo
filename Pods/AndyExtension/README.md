    Attension:The file should be contained in the mainBundle.

  The argument is a dictionary. Just use Model Class call this method, you can get one model contains data as you define.


###### __二、to JSON Model Array__

#### _**Tips:**_

- Two cautions in AndyExtesion, please ignore.That‘s what I imply to use. I’ll fix them in the coming versions.

- Before you run, you need pod install first.(Since I use RAC and Masonry to reduce my codes.)
